# Score Prediction Model Project

This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict students' GPA based on various academic and demographic factors. The dataset is preprocessed by removing the GradeClass and GPA columns to prevent data leakage. The model is trained and evaluated to analyze the impact of different factors on student performance.
